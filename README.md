##News Media Twitter Mode Analysis

In this project, we create da Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news oulets, and to present our findings visually.

Our final output provides a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times.


Background:

Twitter has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out per day. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.


Data Analyst Tools used:
- tweepy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob, and VADER.
- Use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize data


Our Objective:
- Pull the tweets and into a DataFrame, its text, its date, and its compound, positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores.
- Export the data in the DataFrame into a CSV file.
- Have a sentiment analysis with the compound, positive, neutral, and negative scoring for each tweet.
- Save PNG images for each plot.
